# Movie-Vector-Space-Model
Movie and actor comparison by cosine similarity and euclidean distance measures.  This is a simple application of a very powerful tool used in natural language processing (NLP), and was a class final project in Statistical Computing (STATS 597A) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

For the actual code, see the `server.r` file.  For brief non-descript slides, see the presentation pdf.

This method could easily be extended to include movie and actor subtraction by changing a "+" to a "-".  One could also use a cross-product to find the least-similar match by finding a third keyword vector orthogonal to the first two.
